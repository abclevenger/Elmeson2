                  El Meson de Pepe's Chef/Owner, Pepe Diaz, a native of Cuba, has lived in Key West, Florida for many years.
                  His passion for the culinary arts has been a driving force in establishing El Meson de Pepe as a landmark
                  for authentic Cuban cuisine in the Florida Keys.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1984, the Diaz family opened their first restaurant, bringing with them the cherished recipes of their homeland.
                  Today, located right next to the Mallory Square Sunset Celebration, El Meson de Pepe continues to offer a
                  unique dining experience that celebrates the spirit of Havana.
                </p>
