    "content": "Our proud history begins in the small town of Yaguajay, Cuba, where Pepe Diaz was born. As a young man, Pepe began cooking to avoid working in the fields. It was in those early teenage years that he found his passion for food.He set out to begin his career in Spain, working in popular “Meson” restaurants and refining his skills. He started formulating a vision for his future, moving to America and opening his own Meson restaurant. That’s when Pepe moved from Spain to Miami, Florida in the year 1973. Upon his arrival, he started working at La Esquina De Tejas, a popular local restaurant, where he had the pleasure of preparing a delicious meal for President Ronald Reagan. Pepe’s personal life also began to flourish with his wife Cachi and moved to Key West with sons Jose Augusto, Jose Manuel, and daughter Thania.\n\nIn 1979, Pepe began working at the “Cuban Club” in Key West, Florida and simultaneously opened their local family-run grocery store, Tony’s Grocery. The Diaz Family firmly planted their roots within the Conch community and instantly gained notoriety for their delicious deli sandwiches and Cuban Coffee.\n\nIn 1986, it was time for Pepe’s vision to become reality as the family sold the grocery store and opened the first “El Meson De Pepe” on Duval Street. The restaurant became a staple within Key West as the home of authentic Cuban Cuisine. As the years went by the family and the business continued to grow. In 1997,&nbsp; seeking a bigger location to accommodate their growth, El Meson De Pepe found a new home in Mallory Square.\n\nFor over 30 years, Chef Pepe Diaz and his family have been dedicated to pristine quality, authentic Cuban Cuisine, and the preservation of Cuban Conch Heritage in Key West.\n\nBuen Provecho!\n\n<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QwnigygfkRo\\\" width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen=\\\"allowfullscreen\\\"></iframe>",

    "slug": "key-west-cuba-history",
    "excerpt": "",
    "content": "<span style=\\\"font-size: 18px;\\\"><strong>The history of the association of Key West and Cuba is one of the most unusual and fascinating in all of American history. The two islands have been closely linked - culturally, economically, and in other ways for over 175 years. The marriage of the islands has encountered some turbulence, but all in all it has been a most happy one. It began in the 15th and 16th centuries, when Christopher Columbus discovered America and Cuba. Then Ponce de Leon discovered the Florida Keys, Dry Tortugas, and La Florida. At that time Key West and the Florida Keys were inhabited by warring Calusa and other Indians who fished and raised small crops. They preyed on small ships coming to the area from Cuba wrecked along the dangerous Florida Reef.</strong></span>\n\nAs mariners and fishermen, Spanish settlers from Cuba came to the Keys and the Dry Tortugas in small boats, in search of fish, manatees, and the tasty meat and eggs of sea turtles and birds. They camped on the Northwest shore of Key West (now <a href=\\\"https://www.mallorysquare.com\\\">Mallory Square</a><sup>SM</sup>) and returned to Cuba with barrels full of food to sell in the bustling markets of Colonial Spanish Havana.\n\nIn 1815, shortly before Spain ceded the Territory of Florida to the United States, Don Juan Estrada, the Spanish Governor of Florida, granted the island of Cayo Hueso to Juan Pablo Salas. Salas, in turn, sold the island to John Simonton of Mobile, Alabama for $2,000.00 in 1822. Official settlement began in that year, with people coming from near and far - from the east coast of the United States, the former Spanish city of St. Augustine, the Bahamas, Europe, Cuba and other places throughout the Caribbean.\n\nDuring the years that followed, Key West boomed. The lucrative shipwreck and salvage business soon made the geographically small and remote city the wealthiest per capita city in the USA. The equally lucrative cigar industry was introduced from Cuba to Key West in the late 1860’s. Sponging and fishing were vital to the economy. Tourism was to become the third boom in Key West history, with the opening of the Overseas Railroad, pioneering overseas flights and finally the Overseas Highway ... all making both <a href=\\\"/key-west-blog/\\\">Key West</a> and Cuba readily accessible to tourists and businessmen.\n\nThe building, now Cayo Hueso y Habana on Mallory Square<sup>SM</sup> facing the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, was the site where thousands of refugees from Cuba disembarked on American shores during the 19th century. The entire building has been converted into a setting sure to please all who visit it, tourists and locals alike. Inspired in part by the imagination and historical accuracy found in the art work of native son Mario Sanchez, the atmosphere and design of Cayo Hueso y Habana interprets scenes of old Key West and its still existing <a href=\\\"/key-west-cuban-food/\\\">Cuban flavor</a>.\n\nThe cuisine of Cuba quickly became part of Key West’s food heritage when Cuban families began to settle on the island in the 1860’s. The food served in Key West homes and restaurants was excellent, but lacked the spice and zesty flavorings the Cubans brought with them. Non Cubans on the island began including <a href=\\\"/key-west-blog/\\\">Cuban recipes</a> in their daily menus, happy to find new tastes and flavors on their dinner tables. The highly seasoned but not too spicy <a href=\\\"/menu/\\\">Cuban food</a> was a welcome change.\n\nThe special aromas, so much a part of old Key West and other Cuban communities are still here. The smell of the fragrant tobacco of fresh Cuban cigars pervades the air, mingling with that of pungent garlic, onions, Spanish olive oils and other mouth watering scents from the kitchen of El Meson de Pepe’s, a local family owned and operated <a href=\\\"/\\\">restaurant</a> serving Key West’s locals and visitors since 1985.",

For many, it’s the <a href=\\\"https://www.mallorysquare.com/sunset-celebration/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">Mallory Square Sunset Celebration</a>, where the sun sets and the fun begins! The next item on the list might be dining at great local restaurants. Well a visit to El Meson de Pepe checks both of those items off the list. We’re located inside Mallory Square, and in our opinion, nothing goes better with a sunset than a refreshing mojito and a selection of Cuban tapas. In addition to great libations, every evening just before sunset, we have a live Salsa band for everyone to enjoy. Caribe of Key West is the only local Salsa band on the island and performs a variety of Caribbean favorites!\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar with the Mallory Square Sunset Celebration, it’s a nightly festival that begins 2 hours before sunset. The celebration includes street performers, magicians, jugglers, local artists and vendors that all come together for an evening that is uniquely Key West. Visitors and locals alike gather to <a href=\\\"https://www.elmesondepepe.com/key-west-sunset/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">watch one of the most iconic sunsets</a> in the entire world. There are very few places that can experience such a wonderful occasion every evening. El Meson de Pepe is open before, during, and after the celebration offering authentic Cuban dishes and tasty cocktails for everyone to enjoy!",
