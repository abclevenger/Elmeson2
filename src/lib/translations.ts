La familia Díaz se volvió Conch: el Cuban Club, la Grocería Tony y el mostrador donde los habituales venían por café cubano y sándwiches. Esa continuidad fue preparación. En 1986 abrió El Mesón de Pepe en Duval Street. En 1997 se mudó a Mallory Square, donde permanece — un sitio permanente del patrimonio cubanoamericano.",
